# Security Scripts

This repository contains a number of scripts for use in a security team, or by Helpdesk individuals (permissions allowing) to conduct tasks that help harden overall security. 
There are also other scripts within the repository which may help with other tasks or deployments. 

It is advised to deploy from something like intune or even Live response library!  

**Please ensure that all scripts are tested in a Sandbox environment prior to deployment**
Caution: Some scripts **may** brick your environment, review carefully 

### Noteworthy: 

- Some scripts may require to be ran in Admin context.
- Scripts are not signed! 
- Write-Host is not applicable in deployment scenarios such as InTune 

All PRs welcomed
